# Baka4J

**Baka4J** is a simple, yet fast & reliable object wrapper for the bakalari-3 API.
This wrapper aims to provide a modern and efficient interface for interacting with the Bakalari system.

## Motivations

The existing Java wrapper for the [Bakalari API (Baka4J)](https://github.com/PanJohnny/Baka4J),
is no longer maintained and relies on outdated and unnecessary dependencies. Additionally,
the codebase of the existing wrapper does not align with my vision for simplicity and efficiency.

With **Baka4J**, I aim to create a more streamlined and dependency-light library to meet the needs of developers who work with Bakalari.

## Serialization Magic ✨

With Baka4J, the JSON serialization to Java objects is as seamless as slicing through warm butter. Imagine this: a JSON object arrives from the Bakalari API, wrapped up in all its key-value pair glory, and **Baka4J** performs its magic to unwrap it, breathing life into Java objects like they're born anew.

## Features

- Lightweight: Minimizes dependencies to keep the library fast and manageable.
- Reliable: Provides stable access to Bakalari’s API without frequent updates.
- Developer-friendly: The codebase is designed for clarity and ease of use, following modern Java best practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Baka4J**, install the library using Maven or Gradle and refer to the usage examples in the documentation.
